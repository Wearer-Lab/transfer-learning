Below is a step‐by‐step process to refactor the codebase from being tailored specifically to mechanical engineering into a more general-purpose video processing and guide‐generation pipeline. I’ll explain the changes needed in different parts of the code along with high-level recommendations.
─────────────────────────────
Step 1. Analyze and Isolate Domain-Specificity
─────────────────────────────
• Identify modules that embed mechanical engineering details. In this codebase, for example:
  – In models (e.g. models/engineering.py and models/videoProcessing.py), the schema names (DesignStep, EngineeringPrinciple, EngineeringProcess) and their prompts (e.g. “Identify the necessary materials and components”, “Strategic Planning”, “CAD design”) are very specific.
  – The guideGenerator.py file uses prompts and instructions tailored to CAD and mechanical design.
  – The imageAnalysis.py function ‘describe_image’ uses a prompt that instructs the LLM to behave as “a highly skilled mechanical engineer with expertise in CAD design.”

Step 2. Refactor Domain Models into More Generic Entities
─────────────────────────────
• Rename and restructure the domain-specific Pydantic models (DesignStep, EngineeringPrinciple, and EngineeringProcess) to generic ones such as ProcessStep, ProcessPrinciple, and ProcessOverview (or simply VideoProcess).
• Change field names and examples so they are domain agnostic (e.g., “tools_used” remains but the example can change from “CAD software” to “relevant software or tools”, and “techniques_applied” can be “methods used”).
• Modify the models in models/videoProcessing.py to call the new generic models.
─────────────────────────────
Step 3. Replace Hard-Coded Prompts with Configurable or Dynamic Prompts
─────────────────────────────
• In guideGenerator.py, update the system and user prompts so they do not only mention mechanical design. For example, replace the mechanical‐engineering instructions with general instructions like:
  “Your task is to generate a detailed, step‐by‐step guide to replicate the process shown in the video. Focus on the sequential steps, necessary tools or software, key decision points, and potential troubleshooting tips.”
• Consider moving these prompt texts into a configuration file or parameters so that different domains (or “generalist” versus specialized) can easily be selected.
─────────────────────────────
Step 4. Modify the Code in the Video Processing Pipeline
─────────────────────────────
• In videoProcessing.py, adjust any caching or processing logic that assumes a single “engineering” domain.
• Ensure that the transcript combination in documentCombination.py is generalized. For instance, when combining frame descriptions and transcript, remove references to “mechanical design” and instead instruct the LLM to generate a guide for any technical or creative process.
─────────────────────────────
Step 5. Make the CLI More Configurable via Arguments and Settings
─────────────────────────────
• Update the CLI (cli.py) so that it accepts a new flag or parameter (e.g., “--domain general” or “--mode general”) that tells the app to use the general prompts/models.
• In config.py, add settings that let a user define domain-specific overrides. This makes the pipeline modular: the same code is used in “mechanical” mode or “general” mode by loading different prompt templates and model parameters.
─────────────────────────────
Step 6. Modularize the Prompt and Guide Generation
─────────────────────────────
• Create a dedicated module (e.g., guidePrompts.py) where you store prompt templates for different domains. The guideGenerator.py can load the appropriate prompt based on the configuration.
• Refactor the parsing function (parse_guide_text) if necessary to not assume any specific heading names that only fit the mechanical engineering domain. Instead, use generic section identifiers (e.g., “Overview”, “Steps”, “Tips”, “Conclusion”).
─────────────────────────────
Step 7. Update Documentation and Examples
─────────────────────────────
• Update the examples in the JSON schema extras for your Pydantic models to represent generic video processing workflows.
• Document in your README or developer notes how to extend or override prompt templates for other domains. Mention that the pipeline now supports processing local videos and YouTube links to generate step-by-step guides for LLM agents in a domain-agnostic way.
─────────────────────────────
Step 8. Testing and Validation of Refactored Pipeline
─────────────────────────────
• Write unit tests and/or integration tests to ensure that processing a video (whether local or a YouTube link) now produces a generic guide.
• Test various configuration options to verify that the pipeline uses the proper prompt templates.
─────────────────────────────
Step 9. Monitor and Logging Enhancements
─────────────────────────────
• Since the original code uses Rich for CLI logging, ensure that new prompts and message flows are also logged clearly.
• Add monitoring settings through the configuration so that the processing pipeline’s performance (e.g., processing times, transcript generation events) is tracked.
─────────────────────────────
Step 10. Use UV Package Manager and Rich Library for CLI Enhancements
─────────────────────────────
• Integrate the UV package manager if not already done, ensuring that dependencies and packaging reflect the new generalist design.
• Update CLI commands to list new available modes (e.g., a “general” option or a “custom prompt” option).
─────────────────────────────
Summary of Key Changes
─────────────────────────────
• Rename domain-specific models (EngineeringProcess, DesignStep, EngineeringPrinciple) to generic names and update their examples.
• Update prompt templates in both guideGenerator.py and imageAnalysis.py to be generic.
• Parameterize domain-specific instructions (e.g., using CLI flags or config settings) so that the guide generation templates can be switched.
• Ensure caching and processing steps are domain agnostic by removing hard-coded “mechanical design” wording.
• Add documentation and tests to verify that the pipeline works for various types of video processing tasks, not solely mechanical engineering.
─────────────────────────────
By following these steps, you can transform the current codebase into a modular, general-purpose video processing pipeline that not only processes videos but also generates step-by-step guides for LLM agents based on any content type provided.
